# Flappy-Bird-NEAT-AI  
  
A program that uses the NEAT (neuroevolution of augmenting topologies) Genetic Algorithm to train an agent to play the game flappy bird.  
  
The parameters for the NEAT algorithm such as the fitness goal and population size and many more are stored in the config file and can be changed to observe different results.  
  
The fitness function greatly rewards birds for going through a pipe and slightly rewards the birds for making forward progress. It also slightly penalises birds for hitting a pipe.  
  
Credit to the following tutorial series from which I learnt about the NEAT algorithm and used as a reference for this project:
